              Protecting the security of your personal information is very
              important to us. When you transmit personal information from your
              device to our servers, your information is protected by both a
              “firewall” (a combination of computer hardware and software that
              helps keep unauthorized visitors from accessing information within

              layer) encryption. Once we receive your transmission, we will take
              reasonable precautions to ensure its security on our systems.
              While we utilize all of our security and data protection
              preventative measures, the internet is inherently insecure. As a
              result, while eSahyogi strives to protect your personal

              Users are required to sign-in to specific secured areas of

              the user and are designed to safeguard against unauthorized access

              The safety and security of your information also depends on you.

                Most modern web browsers give you the option to send a Do Not
                Track signal to the websites you visit, indicating that you do
                not wish to be tracked. However, there is no accepted standard
                for how a website should respond to this signal, and we do not
                take any action in response to this signal. Instead, in addition
                to publicly available third-party tools, we offer you the
                choices described in this policy to manage the collection and
                use of information about you.
